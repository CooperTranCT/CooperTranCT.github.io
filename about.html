        <p> Hello my name is Cooper Tran and I am 14 years old, <br>
        I am a freshman at La Quinta High School and I am looking <br>
        forward to going to school here. Some of the things that I <br>
        am excited for are the dances, events, and celebrations in <br>
        this school. I have four years here so I will make as many <br>
        memories that I can before I go off to college and leave this <br>
        school behind. I will make every year memorable and fun so that I <br>
        will remember it in the future and think about all the good times <br>
        here. One of my favorite things about this school is how good the <br>
        tennis program is, other things that I admire about this school <br>
        are that it is very open and big and that it has good teachers that <br>
        teach us things that could be helpful in the future. I have many <br>
        hobbies that I do in my freetime and some of them include Some of <br>
        them include playing tennis and volleyball, playing games, swimming, <br> 
        and spending time with friends and family. I am also currently <br> 
        involved in a few clubs including Kiwins and PAWS. I joined <br> 
        Kiwins because it looked fun and so I decided to joined because <br> 
        it is also good for college, and PAWS because it is about <br>
        animals and I like animals.</p>
