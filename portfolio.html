    <h2>My game on Scratch - EPIC 1V1 SIMULATOR!</h2>

    <h2><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/258890315/#player">The Game</a></h2>
    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>It is a game where you have to play with another person. <br>
    You need to try to kill each other, one using Mario and one <br>
    using Bowser. If you touch the airplane it gives you an extra <br>
    life for everytime it appears on the screen. If you need help <br>
    then click the help logo and it will explain everything. The <br> 
    scoring system is each players lives and if one of them go to <br>
    0 then that person loses and dies. The use of randomness <br> 
    occurs when the clouds, airplane, and planet in the back <br> 
    move around in the background. The game gets more difficult <br> 
    when the other player gets a life by touching the airplane. <br> 
    The game ends when the other player dies or loses all their <br>
    health.</p>
    <h3>Reflection:</h3>
    <p>We made this game because of our inspiration to make a game <br>
    that would allow the users to both control a sprite and use <br>
    them to fight each other. One successful point in the <br> 
    development process of our game is that we learned how to <br>
    make a two player game that allowed them to fight and we <br>
    also learned how to make sprites seem like they are flying. <br>
    An obstacle in our game were making the music play but we <br>
    overcame that by learning how it worked and by implementing <br>
    our own music. Another obstacle that came along the way is when <br>
    we tried to make the characters shoot each other and take damage <br>
    and we overcame this by using an idea from another person's <br>
    line of code. If we had more time and resources then we would've <br>
    fixed up the background and made the welcome screen and icons <br>
    look a lot nicer and better.</p>
    <h3>Algorithm:</h3>
    <img src="algorithm.PNG" alt="algorithm">
    <p>I chose this algorithm from my program because it had a <br>
    significant purpose in the working parts of the game. It <br>
    was used to make one of the sprites be able to be controlled <br>
    by a player to avoid the attacks of the opposing player. <br>
    It was a very important part of the game, but it was also <br>
    one of the easier parts of it because it did not take a lot <br>
    to accomplish it just a few simple blocks of code and an idea <br>
    to allow two sprites to be controlled by two players fighting <br>
    each other to the death until boredom.</p>

    <p>Our game is about our main character, Colin Reed, getting stranded <br>
    on an island after a plane crash. He needs to find his way through the island <br>
    to survive for as long as he can. Throughout the journey strange things may happen.</p>

    <p>I started off by brainstorming ideas for the story and then discussing with Ben until we made a compromise. <br>
    In the beginning, I had some trouble with agreeing with Ben about the theme of the story, but later on we decided it. <br>
    After many lines of code I decided to change the text speed and decisions to my liking. This made it clear and easy to read <br>
    as well as the code running more smoothly. I coded the entire game myself while Ben helped with the game labels. <br>
    Sometimes while I was coding it had errors running, but then I was assisted to learn that it was a spacing error. </p>
    <p>The organizination of scenes into functions is one of the forms of procedural abstraction because it allows code <br>
    to work without the user's knowledge of how it works. It's because of how easy it flows and seperates the code into <br>
    smaller pieces. The advantages of abstraction are that it makes it so that mistakes in the code only need to be <br>
    fixed in one spot, and that it is easier to test certain portions of the code.</p>
    <p>A story that I read was "Ziggy's", and it was very enjoyable because of how entertaining <br>
    and funny the plot was, another story that I read was "CHICAGO" and it really made me think about <br>
    how well made it was.</p>
